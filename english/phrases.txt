生活就是这样，孩子
年轻时围绕在你身边的朋友，邻居，酒友，耍宝搭档，
会随着时光的推移，慢慢失去联系
孩子们，你们会惊讶的发现
在生活中，轻易的就会与某人永远不再见
所以，当你找到你想与之相伴的人时
你就得紧紧抓住

And thats how it goes,kids.
The friends,neighbors,drinking buddies and partners in crime you love so much when youre young,
sa the years go by,you just lose touch.
You will be shocked,kids,
when you discover how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever.
Thatd why when you finf someone you want to keep around,
you do something about it.



痛苦分 两种
一种让你变得更强
另一种毫无价值
只是徒添折磨
我对没有价值的东西也没耐心

there are two kinds of pain 
The sort of pain that makes you strong
or useless pain
The sort of pain thats only suffering
I have on patience for useless things.


我以为，开口的时间，地点很重要
后来才发现
唯一重要的是你
你让我得到超乎想象的幸福
我愿意用下半生，让你跟我一样幸福
莫妮卡
你愿意嫁给我吗


I thought,waht I said or where I said it.
Then I realized,
the only thing that matters is that you.
You make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
Ill spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way.
Monica,will you marry me？
